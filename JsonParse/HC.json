Cycle tracks may be shared with pedestrians.\nYou should give way to cyclists approaching or using the cycle track when you are turning into or out of a junction (see 'Rule H3'). Be prepared to stop and wait for a safe gap in the flow of cyclists before crossing the cycle track, which may be used by cyclists travelling in both directions.\nBear in mind that cyclists are not obliged to use cycle lanes or cycle tracks.",
